## 2. Code (1.5 hr)

review of day 2
Learning about Processing-- drawing shapes with Python.
X and Y coordinate system, just like algebra or geometry
Instead of (0, 0) being lower left, it's upper left.
Positive Y goes down the screen.

Python Processing commands:
ellipse: Draw a circle, specifying center and radii
rectangle: Draw a rectangle, specifying upper left coordinates, width, and height
line: Draw a line, specifying start coordinates (X-Y) and end coordinates (X-Y)
point: Draw a point (X, Y)
text: Draw text, at specified (X, Y) location

Color: specify a color like:
c = Color(red, green, blue)
replace red, green, and blue with a number 0-255
The higher the number, the more that color appears.

Then use fill(c), and the next shape will be filled with that color.
