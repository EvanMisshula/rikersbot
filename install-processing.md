# Processing Installation Instructions

## Step 1: Download Processing studio
On the computer you want to run on, install Processing: https://processing.org/download/?processing
Select "Linux 64-bit".
This will download a tar archived directory.


## Step 2: Unpack Processing
Open up a terminal.
In the directory with the tar file you downloaded above (should be named something like processing-3.0.1-linux64.tgz) run the following command:
> tar -zxvf processing-3.0.1-linux64.tgz
replacing that filename with whatever the name actually is.


## Step 3: Install Python on Processing
The last step should have made a directory named process-3.0.1 (or something similar).
cd into that directory and run ./processing.
In the upper right, it will say "Java". 
Click on this, click a button that says something like "Install other modes", and select python.


## Step 4: Open up start.py
I've included a basic python file called start.py. 
Try opening this in Processing studio.
It might give you some error message, just click okay.
Eventually, when you run it, a window should pop that that has some geometric drawings in it.
Good job! You've install Processing with python mode.
