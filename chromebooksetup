We are using Lenovo N21 Chromebooks

1. Start in Developer mode by holding Esc + Refresh + Power button
2. Press Ctrl + D 
3. Press Enter
    - Computer displays "OS verification is OFF", beeps, goes dark, "Your system is transitioning to Developer Modes", reboots 
4. Standard chromebook setup
    - Log in to Rikersbot [at] gmail.com 
    - Check version of Google Chrome OS (should update to most recent version on its own) 
5. Settings> Advanced Settings > Powerwash > wait for it to reboot, then click "Enable Debugging Features" > Proceed on the start up screen
6. Enter Rikersbot [at] gmail [dot] com password, should display "You have successfullly enabled debugging features on this Chrome device." 


- We turned off computers and pressed Esc + Refresh + Power button to restart, but holding Ctrl + D no longer works. :( 
- Ctrl + Alt + T opens the Chrome OS Developer Shell 
---- type "shell" to start shell 
- Powerwash
