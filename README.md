## Description

*Rikers Bot* is a joint project between [XPMethod](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) and [Center for Justice at Columbia](http://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/). It aims are to provide the young people at Rikers training and experience in digital storytelling, and minimal programming. The workshop will run for five Saturdays and includes undergraduate students from Columbia. On the storytelling front, we focus on #RikersIsnthome-- a hashtag that emerged from our conversation at the first gathering. On the programming front, we will design and implement a bot that will tweet the storyline (@rikersbot). As we set up the story-writing and programming apparatus, we work in teams divided into Editors, Producers and Programmers. We will credit the young people in the program here, and provide them with proper accredition for participating.
