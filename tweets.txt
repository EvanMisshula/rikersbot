Today we woke up before the chicken cawed. We walked to our usual tables to eat our cardboard bread with processed Jelly. [1/3]
We also ate our usual water filled "oatmeal." [2/3]
Today we are locked in because an alam went off. #TSO [3/3]

Well This place sucks because we have to listen to officers-- when we can shower, eat, and sleep. [1/2] 
We also have to PAY to call our loved ones. #15minutecalls #exiledFromTheFreeWorld [2/2]

Now we have to listen to officers complain about how "annoying" some of us are. I feel officers have favorites when it comes to inmates.

Its locked-in time, its quiet besides the airplane engines roaring through our windows, and inmates from different houses yelling. [1/2]
Theres no SPA (Suicide Prevention Aid) on the teir. The mice are out #MiceDoingSPA [2/2]
 
The most unsanitary place to hold the youth.

One Determines Your Life without Knowing yhou or nearly seeing you-- the judge! 

Am I a criminal because of my childish mistakes? People change give the youth a chance. 

Have you ever been chased by 30 people

Where's the millions? 

The correctional officers are incarcerated with us. They work triples, go home to sleep, come right back. 

Money is just money you have to love what you do to be truly happy. 

Trying to move forward and not dwell on time.

He said, "They tell me I'm 30 years old, but I'm 17."

F*** I woke up in the morning like damn I got to wash my clothes this morning. 

I went to court yesterday and I was kinda upset because the judge offered me 1-3 years #SMH

The same as everyday. Played ball in the gym. 

Almost got bit breaking up a dog fight. 

Jail is like a camp. 

bread jelly milk spaghetti + meatballs fried fish oatmeal coffee creamer peanut butter: certain foods doesnt taste good #Rikersisnthome

played regular uno after the gym

another inmate, another dollar

Day to day dreams, thinking about the world on the other side.

The days move on as it feels like the earth stands still. 

The food and games are such a delight / that you leave in the day and return in the night.

The nightmare rehappens incarceration in a cell. When we'll come out, we will never tell.

The breakout of fights are like a combustion of pimples. It brings us down in character. 

you will never know true misery till you loose the most priceless thing given to men: thats freedom

every saint has a past but every sinner has a future

my fate is in the hands of a judge who never been in my shoes

I went to a dirtyass cell waiting to go to court and see the Judge and they were talking about sentencing me #SMH

The fish I ate yesterday almost broke my tooth

He said, "I have twenty eight stitches in my back." 

He said, "We need a hurricane to get a breeze."
