Who am I? 

Does Our Past Determine & Deprive Our Future...? 

The voices of the night are like a room full of politices

God forgives courts don't!

I didn't know water bug fly!

The world is a Jail are we really free? 

Those who lack intellect and in-Dept learning lose to the system

Jail make us feel deprived and cause vagueness-- lacking definite form or character

I'm not playing with guns no more

"They ain't ready for us, man."

#WherestheSympathy

We read some bell hooks together w the Columbia group-- wonder if we should be reading it w the young ppl @ Rikers too? 

Remembering the writers that moved me at 16 + 17: Audre Lord, bell hooks, Judith Butler, James Baldwin, Assata Shakur, Malcolm X

#RikersReadingGroup after #Rikersbot? 

"It's at 6 p.m.? In the night?? Past curfew?!?!!?!" 

Girls, drugs, and guns got me here

Some fight for respect  + others fight for survival

Salute me or shoot me

A crip use one phone a blood use the other

A lion helps the sheep grow #righteous king

slashings and fights get you known #browniepoints

jail is a political world

bad is good good is bad
