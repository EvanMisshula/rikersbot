We are using Lenovo N21 Chromebooks

- Switch to developer mode
-- testing double indent

- Start in Developer mode by holding Esc + Refresh (F3) + Power button

- Press Ctrl + D 

- Press Enter
    - Computer displays "OS verification is OFF", beeps, goes dark, "Your system is transitioning to Developer Modes", reboots 

- Standard chromebook setup
    - Log in to Rikersbot [at] gmail.com 
    - Check version of Google Chrome OS (should update to most recent version on its own) 
    
- Settings> Advanced Settings > Powerwash. Wait for it to reboot, then click "Enable Debugging Features" > Proceed on the start up screen

- Enter Rikersbot [at] gmail [dot] com password, should display "You have successfullly enabled debugging features on this Chrome device." 
-ctrl-alt-f2 to enter shell

- Install Debian 
`sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r stretch -t lxde -n debian`

`-r` is the release. We need to set this to stretch, which is the testing branch of Debian. If the -r switch is not passed Ubuntu will be installed.

`-t` is the target command that specifies what GUI interface you want installed by default. Gnome is the default gui for kali however it does not work on my HP Chromebook 14â€³. KDE works and is a  good alternative to Gnome.

`-n` is the name parameter. We define the -n switch here so we can give the chroot a custom name of debian.

- launch lxde from crosh
`Ctrl+Alt+t` to launch crush, then `shell`, and `sudo startlxde`

- you can flip through running chroot desktops by pressing `ctrl+alt+shift+Back/Forward`

- install atom, ipython, and ipython notebook
in the lxde terminal run `sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook`
